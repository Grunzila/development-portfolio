Project Report

This project has achieved an index page with the necessary format to
be beautiful and a coherent profile. The index page also contains the
necessary qualities to be a portfolio as it contains links to Django
template pages for projects. CSS styling is consistent between pages,
HTML contains dynamic Django, and pages are easily added through the
admin. Some items have not been accomplished at the time this report
was written. Yet to be achieved is a blurb that is different when the
page is reloaded, but will print out all available blurbs. Javascript
is yet to be utelized; however, javascript is planned to solve the
issue with the blurbs. An audio item is yet to be included in the
project. A temporary instance has been created, this will replaced
when a file has been uploaded.
